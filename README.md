Arabic++ Lexical Analyzer (Scanner) – README

This repository contains the implementation of a Lexical Analyzer (Scanner) for a custom-designed programming language called Arabic++, developed as part of a Compiler Construction course (Phase 1).

The scanner is implemented using Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator) and processes an Arabic-inspired mini-language by recognizing keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, punctuations, strings, and characters, while also reporting lexical errors along with line numbers.

Project Structure
File	Description
scanner.l	Main Flex source file containing token rules, regex patterns, and token printing logic.
sample.atc	A custom test program written in Arabic++ used to test the scanner. (Minimum 20 lines)
tokens.txt	Output generated by the scanner showing the tokenized form of sample.atc.
errors_output.txt	Scanner output for errors.atc, showing reported lexical errors with line numbers.
README.md	Overview and explanation of the project (this file).

0521_CC_P1.pdf	Written project documentation submitted with the assignment.

Note: Output files (tokens.txt, errors_output.txt) are generated automatically after running the scanner.

How to Compile and Run

Make sure Flex and GCC are installed.
On Linux / WSL / macOS, run:

flex scanner.l        # Generates lex.yy.c
gcc lex.yy.c -lfl -o scanner   # Compiles scanner
./scanner sample.atc > tokens.txt


To test error handling:

./scanner errors.atc > errors_output.txt


If running interactively:

./scanner

Purpose & Learning Outcome

The goal of this project is to understand how a compiler begins processing source code by:

Reading input character by character

Grouping characters into meaningful tokens

Recognizing valid/invalid lexical patterns

Reporting line-by-line structured output

This scanner forms the first stage of our compiler.
Future phases will include parsing, semantic analysis, and translation/execution.
